# Horiseon Webpage

## Challenge
For this assignment, I was tasked with refactoring the code for Horiseon Social Solutions Services webpage. Previously, the marketing webpage had accessibility issues such as inconsistency of color, redundant code, code without clear comments and broken links. After implementing changes, the website accessibility went from 70% to 90% which is an important element for a good business since it enables them to be better positioned for search engines.

## Requirements

### User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Final Result
